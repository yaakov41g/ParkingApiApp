# ParkingApp 🚗  
A voice-driven parking registration system with an ASP.NET Core backend and a React Native mobile client.
This project was built with extensive support from AI Copilot, which generated the code. 
My role has been to understand the code, to design and refine the system — making architectural decisions, improving the flow, and shaping the user experience.

#### Development is done using Visual Studio as the primary IDE.

## 🧭 User Flow

1. **Welcome Prompt**  
   - The app plays a short welcome message using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS).

2. **Speech Recording**  
   - The user records their voice using Expo Audio APIs.  
   - The audio is processed and converted (via FFmpeg).

3. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**  
   - The recorded audio is sent to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (STT).  
   - The transcribed city name is extracted and sent to the mobile.
       
4. **User Confirmation**  
   - The app gets back the detected city name and sends back, using TTS(Text To Speech), to the user for confirmation.  
   - The user confirms or corrects the city name.

5. **City Name Validation**  
   - The backend checks if the city exists in the Redis/MongoDB database.  
   - If needed, the name is translated using Google Cloud Translate.

### *In next versions*
6. **Zone Selection**  
   - If the city is valid, the app fetches available parking zones.  
   - The user selects a zone via the mobile UI.

7. **Parking Registration**  
   - The app registers the parking session.  
   - Optionally stores session data in Redis for fast access.

8. **Confirmation Playback**  
   - A final confirmation message is played using TTS.

### 🔙 Backend
- **ASP.NET Core** – RESTful API
- **MongoDB** – City and zone data
- **Redis** – Optional caching layer
- **Docker** – Containerized deployment
- **Google Cloud APIs**:
  - Text-to-Speech (TTS)
  - Speech-to-Text (STT)
  - Translate API
- **FFmpeg** – Audio format conversion

### 📱 Mobile
- **React Native** – Cross-platform mobile app
- **Expo** – Simplified development and audio recording
- **Fetch API** – Communication with backend

## 🧪 Features in Progress
- Multi-language support
- citie list from API
- Admin dashboard for city/zone management

---

## 📁 Configuration
- Cities and zones are seeded via JSON files.
- Environment variables control API keys and endpoints.
- Setting up local Wi-Fi communication between server and mobile device (took a full day to stabilize).
- Overcoming GitHub's handling issues.
